###### AEM10941 IC
Solar energy harvester with MPPT for low power devices based on `epeas`
`AEM10941` IC.

`AEM10941` is an integrated energy management circuit that extracts DC power
from up to 7-cell solar panels to simultaneously store energy in a
rechargeable element and supply the system with two independent regulated
voltages. The AEM10941 allows to extend battery lifetime and ultimately
eliminates the disposable battery energy storage element in a large range of
wireless applications, such as industrial monitoring, geolocation, home
automation, e-health monitoring and wireless sensor nodes.

###### Motivation
The purpose is to create standalone solar cell module, which is 
ready for measurements and testing. In future in may become a part of larger
project.
