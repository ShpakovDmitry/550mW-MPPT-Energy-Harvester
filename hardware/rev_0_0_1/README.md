###### Revision 0.0.1 flaws
Schematic:
1. `L1` has incorrect connection. Should be connected to `BUFSRC` not to `BOOST`.

PCB:
1. Via's for `C1` are quite small. Inner diameter should be bigger.
1. Silkscreen for `X3` is big compared to other `X` connectors.
1. Silkscreen for `G1, G2` is upside-down.
1. Top solder mask on `D1` `EPAD` should be removed.
1. Mounting holes should be connected to `GND` net.
1. Ground connection for `G1, G2` should be without thermal barrier. This is for higher currents.
